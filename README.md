# CZ1007 : Data Structure

## Learning Outcome
After completing the course, I have gained excellent understanding of **C syntax** and various types of **data structures** and their **pros and cons**.

## Coursework Assignment
Implementation of code for a given set of data structure related questions. Tasks include implementation of : 

- a function that aims to ``sort`` the items in the ``linkedlist`` in the ascending order.
- a function that aims to move all the odd items in a linkedlist to the back and the even items, to the front
- a function that aims to ``create`` a ``Queue`` based on the items from a linkedlist. 
- a function that aims to remove all the odd items from the Queue
- a function that aims to print the items in a ``Binary Search Tree`` in post-order manner by using ``iterative method`` with ``two stacks``

## Knowledge Accquired includes: 

1. Basic Constructs in C program structure, Syntax and semantics

2. Built-in Data Structures

3. Recursion

3. Memory Management in C

4. Linked Lists

5. Stacks and Queues

6. Tree Structures

7. Implementing other data abstractions
